## Assessment Step 2.

### Django Projects:
- [To-Do App](https://github.com/kkothari2001/django-todo): App that can be used to maintain a list of tasks that can be dynamically added and deleted once completed.
- [URL Shortner](https://github.com/kkothari2001/django-url-shortner): A bitly clone that stores URLs in a database as a hash and redirects when the URL is clicked.

Please Note: While these projects show my Django skills, I believe they might not be the best way to show some of my other web development skills like web design. I urge you to go through the following links which are a showcase of some of the best projects I have made.

- [The SRA Website](https://sravjti.tech/): This is the website for the Society of Robotics and Automation, VJTI. I am a member of it and have made the entire site using HTML,Sass(CSS) and JavaScript. The code is curently private (because we are working on a backend authentication system right now). But if you wish, I can provide a bundled together zip archive of all the front end mockups in HTML,Sass and JS.

- [twAIn](https://github.com/kkothari2001/twAIn): As the punny name suggests, we created an AI in python that can write awesome stories after being trained on many modern classics! For this project I created the Web UI, and worked on the GPT-2 model that produces the stories.
