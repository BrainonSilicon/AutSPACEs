## Assessment Step 2
[Todo-App](https://github.com/anoura12/todo-app) - A basic Django todo application where you can create and update tasks.
I've used HTML and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

## Assessment Step 3
The development requirement that I would like to work on is the additional design requirements for the website.
Most of the worldâ€™s autistic population uses the web for their personal needs, and the number keeps increasing every year. It so happens that most websites have a user interface not quite attuned to their needs and requirements. The bright colors, glary screens, ambiguous symbols, and cluttered layouts overwhelm autistic users because this triggers their sensory processing sensitivities. Hence, I would like to create a simple but effective user interface that makes it easier for them to navigate the Autistica website. 

I have gone through Sprint No. 6 where the site was tested on autistic people/parents of autistic people and I have researched different UIs best suited for autistic people. I concluded that the website design can be broken down into 4 categories-
1. Layout
2. Color
3. Text
4. Symbols
