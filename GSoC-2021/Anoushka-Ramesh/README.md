## Assessment Step 2
[Todo-App](https://github.com/anoura12/todo-app) - A basic Django todo application where you can create and update tasks.
I've used HTML and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

## Assessment Step 3
The development requirement that I would like to work on is the additional design requirements for the website.
Most of the worldâ€™s autistic population uses the web for their personal needs, and the number keeps increasing every year. It so happens that most websites have a user interface not quite attuned to their needs and requirements. The bright colors, glary screens, ambiguous symbols, and cluttered layouts overwhelm autistic users because this triggers their sensory processing sensitivities. Hence, I would like to create a simple but effective user interface that makes it easier for them to navigate the Autistica website. 

I have gone through Sprint No. 6 where the site was tested on autistic people/parents of autistic people and I have researched different UIs best suited for autistic people. I concluded that the website design can be broken down into 4 categories-
1. Layout
2. Color
3. Text
4. Symbols

**The pictures below are the pages I'm referring to while I'm talking about the design** 

### :book: Landing Page -

### :eye: Views -
#### List View-

#### Table View-

### Layout
* The card view on the landing and experiences page are nice but the size of each card could be increased so that the text doesn't look as congested.
* The How it Works card should be the biggest among the rest or it should be highlighted in some manner because a lot of test users said that the particular card was the first thing they focused on.
* 
* In the experiences pages, the buttons on the enter experiences look clustered up as well. So either the card size could be increased or the buttons could be placed outside the card right next to it for better spacing 
* From the both the views, I believe the list view would be a much better option because:-
  1. The table view looks too mathemathical as mentioned by one of the autistic test users in the sprint
  2. With a good amount of spaces and proper gridlines, The list view can be implemented to show all the user experiences. A similar card view like that in my todo-app can be done here
* 



### Colour
* More pastel colours can be incorporated for the default settings of the page. Additional changes can be configured in the settings page
* After researching a bit, pale pink is the colour that a lot of autistic users love.
* The orange button in the landing page seems to stand out. A little bit of contrast is required to make the other elements stand out as mentioned by the autistic test users, i.e. the current page is too plain for their liking
* Colours like this could be included-

### Text
* In the enter experiences page, the text contained inside the card which tells the user what to enter needs to be darker.
* Explanation of the aims on the landing page needs to be more concise
* Some users were confused between the save and the upload button on the enter experiences page. Maybe one button for submitting the data could be used instead
* The 'Non-Verbal' button could be changed to 'Read the Page'

### Symbols
* In the landing page, the symbol for the configure card was ambiguous for the users. Maybe a gear icon or a wrench tool could be used for configure and a book icon could be used for how it works.
* The stack icon on the experiences page was vague as well.

### Accessibility Settings and Screen Reader
The accessibility of hte site can definitely be increased to
